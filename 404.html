<h1>Young, Educated Chinese Can't Find Work.
AreColleges to Blame?</h1>
<p>For many graduates of the class of '23, landing their ideal job can seem daunting. Unemployment among young urbanites hit unprecedented highs last summer, and China began rolling out stimulus measures and hiring targets months ago inpreparation for another challenging graduation season.

China's 1999 decision to expand access to higher education produced a more educated workforce and helped fuel the next decade or so of growth. But now, many highly-educated young Chinese are questioning whether college degrees still make them competitive on the job market.

Employers seem to be wondering the same thing. Ifyou ask companies why they're not hiring, they'll insist the problem isn't a lack of jobs. Rather, it's ashortage of workers with the skills they require.

In a forthcoming study, we found that 24% of graduates suffered from a "vertical mismatch"- that is, they were over-credentialed for their current positions. Those who graduated from average institutions of higher learning, whose grades were mediocre, or who had a poor grasp of English were the most likely to be affected.

Meanwhile, 34% suffered from a"horizontal mismatch" between their degrees and the job market, meaning they were engaged in occupations that had little relevance to their fields of study. Interestingly, the biggest victims weren't humanities majors, but graduates of niche science, engineering, and agriculturalstudies programs.

The underlying reason for this disjuncture between applicant qualifications and employer needs is a low degree of what sociologists term "school-to-work linkage" - that is, the degree ofociation between education and association between education andoccupation in a given country or region.

The model high "school-to-work linkage country is Germany, where enterprises and schools work closely to train future talents under the country's dual apprenticeship system. One study found that the higher linkage between schools and the workplace, the greater the impact of educational qualifications on individualsalaries and lower the risk of unemployment.

Currently, however, there is a weak linkage between education institutions and the labor market in China. Morebroadly.market-oriented reforms have profoundly influenced China's occupational structure. The digital revolution of the past few years has given rise to new job categories and career paths - and left schools scrambling to keep pace. Schools don't yet teach thes kills currently in high demand, leaving students in the lurch when they hit the job market.

There's little chance that these issues will resolve themselves anytime soon. With a new technological revolution taking the world by storm, research in many post secondary institutions now lags behind the industry forefront. In thefuture, schools and companies must foster stronger linkage and closer ties, or risk the gap between academia and the work place widening further.

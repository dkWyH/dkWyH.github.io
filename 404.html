<p>The US can no longer laughoff the 'bad at math'mentality

United Kingdom Prime Minister RishiSunak recently announced an effort to reverse an "anti-math" culture in hiscountry."We say things like: 'Oh, maths.I can't do that, it's not for me' - and everyone laughs"Sunak said."But we'd never make a joke like that about not being able to read." 

Of course, he was talking about the plight of U.K. children. But the problem is farworse in the U.S., judging by the most recent international rankings of students. which were done pre-pandemic before the wheels really came off math performance.

Sunak captures a cultural predicament omnipresent in the U.S. There is anaccepted and acceptable norm where people intellectually self-select and divide themselves along the lines of "good at math" and "poor at math." That process begins during early education years, and if it solidifies during high school, people are likely to define themselves that way for the rest of their lives in terms of numeracy - with a huge impact on their career choices, wage potential and upward mobility.

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. which is a financial sponsor of myorganization, the Collaborative for Student Success. is more often than not in headlines for its work to stem diseases and improve health abroad. The foundation is throwing its considerable weight and resources behind programs toimprove math education and performance here at home with a $1 billion commitment.

During a recent interview. Bill Gates noted that for kids especially, "it's veryeasy to check out from math and it's very easy to think, okay, I'm not going to be ascientist, so I don't need it." But he explained further that a greater grasp of math is essentially about a better understanding of the world. The data statistics and trends that illuminate and drive the most compelling topics and fields of study are driven by math.

He said that a big focus for turning around math in the U.S.is changing the classroom experience so that childrenappreciate the value of paying attention and see that they can succeed, which builds confidence and persistence in basic math skills. He calls this a process of"resuscitating  curiosity" in students.

The downsides of not addressing theproblem of math education in the U.S.are steep. Numerate people are needed for the military, for careers in science and medicine. for careers outside science, to close wage gaps among demographic groups and to ensure that the U.S. and allcitizens can grow and succeed and stay competitive.</p>

<h1>Confucius exhibition launched in Madrid, showcasing Confucianism's origins and the allure of Chinese traditional culture</h1>
<p>The "Exemplary Master of All Times - Confucius Culture Theme Exhibition" opened at the China Cultural Center in Madrid on Tuesday, providing an opportunity for locals to delve into the origins of Confucianism and appreciate the charm of Chinese traditional culture in contemporary society.

Organized jointly by the China Cultural Center in Madrid and the Shandong Provincial Department of Culture and Tourism, the exhibition showcases the biography and thoughts of Confucius through illustrations, replicas of related cultural artifacts, as well as creative cultural products.

About 60 Chinese and Spanish guests attended the event, including Marcelo Munoz, founder and president emeritus of the think-tank Catedra China, and Yang Changqing, director of the China Cultural Center in Madrid.

During his address, Yang said that Confucius' thoughts not only constitute the soul of Chinese traditional culture but also shape the spiritual character of the Chinese nation. This exhibition, which was launched on the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Spain, is expected to further promote mutual understanding between the two countries, he said.

A multilingual digital exhibition platform dedicated to Confucius culture has been unveiled simultaneously to disseminate the exhibition. The exhibition will remain open until July 28 before embarking on a tour across various regions of Spain.

Munoz emphasized the cautionary significance of Confucius' thoughts in contemporary society and expressed his hope that more and more Spaniards would gain a profound understanding of Confucius and the essence of his teachings.

During the opening ceremony, various interactive activities showcasing Chinese traditional culture, such as monotype and tea ceremonies, were held. Additionally, a Spanish version of a short video featuring some classical quotes from "The Analects of Confucius" played in a loop, captivated the attention of visitors within the exhibition hall.
